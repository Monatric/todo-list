# Project: Todo List

This is a Todo List app made with JavaScript, [guided by The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list). This wraps up all the lessons covered so far in this course, and thus I will be implementing a lot of what I've learned here, including (but not limited to) Webpack, factory functions, modules, ES6 syntaxes, and more.
